para mí

i dont really know how to start this, i have made several versions of this thing, but they usually get lost in my files. I dont think this will be the case.
I am not in the mood to remember everything but basically, since i remember, i was different, i was a quiet little boy, most of the time i was in complete silence, didnt have a lot of friends, never wanted to be in public, always feeling like i never belonged anywhere. 

"My whole life i didnt know if i really existed....", do i?. I dont know what else to say.

There is a piece of me in all this people.

-Elliot Anderson
-Gustav Ahr
-Jon Snow
-Sherlock Holmes(benedict cumberbatch)
-Charlie Kelmeckis
-Will Hunting
-Agent K
-Bruce Wayne(cristian bale)
-Arthur Fleck
-Anakin Skywalker
-Eddard Stark
-Joel Barish
-Peter Parker (tobey maguire)
-Tyler Durden
-Alan Turing

I am probably missing some names but they are most of them.
